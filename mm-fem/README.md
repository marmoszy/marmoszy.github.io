## mm-fem 

The html and freefem code for the calculation of piezoelectric circular disk vabrations in the air (free vibrations). It implements variational equations in axisymetric mode. As material coefficients it uses PIC255 piezoelectric data. The default frequency is defined to be close to the thickness resonanse mode.
